# Analogue Pocket Beta Core Status
Below is list of all of [Jotego](https://www.patreon.com/jotego)'s work-in-progress beta cores for Analogue Pocket, and links to where to get the files. I'll keep this page up-to-date as new cores are released - if you’d like to be notified when this page updates, you can watch this GitHub repo. 

_I'm not associated with Jotego, aside from being a Patreon supporter. If you spot a mistake or have a feature request, please raise an issue and I'll look into it._


## Current JT Beta Cores (Patrons only)
Patrons can access these betas by downloading the .zip files from the Patreon posts linked below.

## When will these cores be released for everyone?
Typically cores are made available to everyone after a few weeks - the current average is around **80 days**. If you enjoy the work José and his team do, I strongly encourage you to support their [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/jotego) and help fund future FPGA development.

## These cores all have weird names in my Pocket menu!
If you want your JT cores to have more accurate names, manufacturer info and images, there's a few easy ways to fix that:
* The Pocket updater apps by [mattpannella](https://github.com/mattpannella/pocket-updater-utility) and [RetroDriven](https://github.com/RetroDriven/Pocket_Updater) now include a setting to automatically correct JT platform names when installing.
* [Pocket Sync](https://github.com/neil-morrison44/pocket-sync) can download pre-made platform metadata and images; it's also the easiest way to manually edit platform info, or make your own images. It can help grab any necessary files needed to run the cores, too.
* Dyreschlock's [Platform Overrides repo](https://github.com/dyreschlock/pocket-platform-images) has a bunch of great pre-made platform info files and images for current and future JT cores that you can drag and drop onto your SD card (these are also available via Pocket Sync, see above).
