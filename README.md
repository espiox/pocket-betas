# Analogue Pocket JT Beta Core Status

Below is a list of [Jotego](https://www.patreon.com/jotego)'s work-in-progress beta cores for Analogue Pocket. Starting in September 2023, a jtbeta.zip file is needed in order to use beta releases - download the latest version from the link below (Patreon login needed). Once cores are released to the public, this file is no longer needed. 

**[Latest jtbeta.zip file (5th Jan 2024)](https://www.patreon.com/posts/neogeo-pocket-95909155)**

There are two ways to install beta cores:
* **Easy Mode:** Use [Pocket Sync](https://github.com/neil-morrison44/pocket-sync), [Pupdate](https://github.com/mattpannella/pupdate) or [Pocket Updater](https://github.com/RetroDriven/Pocket_Updater). Just place jtbeta.zip in the root of your SD card and run the updater - they'll handle the rest.
* **Manual Mode:** Unzip jtbeta.zip and place the beta.bin file into "Assets/[core]/common" for each core.
If you have issues with installation, ensure all your cores are up-to-date, and check [this article by Jotego](https://www.patreon.com/posts/unplayable-only-92457856).

## When will these cores be released for everyone?
Cores are made available to the public after a few weeks or a few months, depending on whether the core is a brand new core, or a port from MiSTer - the current average is around **97 days**. If you enjoy the work José and his team do, I strongly encourage you to support their [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/jotego) and help fund future FPGA development.

## These cores all have weird names in my Pocket menu!
If you want your JT cores to have more accurate names, manufacturer info and images, there's a few easy ways to fix that:
* [Pupdate](https://github.com/mattpannella/pupdate) and [Pocket Updater](https://github.com/RetroDriven/Pocket_Updater) include a setting to automatically correct JT platform names when installing.
* [Pocket Sync](https://github.com/neil-morrison44/pocket-sync) can download pre-made platform metadata and images; it's also the easiest way to manually edit platform info, or make your own images. It can help grab any necessary files needed to run the cores, too.
* Dyreschlock's [Platform Overrides repo](https://github.com/dyreschlock/pocket-platform-images) has a bunch of great pre-made platform info files and images for current and future JT cores that you can drag and drop onto your SD card (these are also available via Pocket Sync, see above).
